## Method
### Operating principle
`Color Sensor`:
- When an object is illuminated with white light, it reflects 
the wavelengths of light that correspond to its inherent 
color.
- Reflected light can be used to determine an object’s color.
- A photoresistor’s resistance varies with light intensity
- Cellophane can assist in filtering light
- Combining these helps detect the intensity of specific 
colored light

### Machine Learning
- use MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) as the model architecture.
